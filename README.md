# HiddenMarkovModel
This is a first implementation of Hidden Markov Model. Only the gaussian emission is implemented.

# Known issues
- Numerical instability in transition matrix for low visited states
- High sensibility to initial states calculated
- Does not penalize enough for high variance
- Slow implementation using loops instead of vectorization
